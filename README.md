Hello I am Greenswat. 
I am currently progressing in C++. 
I started my computer coding  journey 2020 but never really did it routinely and ended up with just learning to print a few lines and use if statements in python. 
However, at the beginning of 2022 I was introduced to leetcode which has some fun problems to solve. 
Hence I decided to learn C++ because in the internet I found that people said it was a very powerful language and is used in various fields of the computer world.

I primarily want to build games which are entertaining, well-made as well as other applications. 
:)
